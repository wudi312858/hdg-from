hdg-from |---| Generate HDG files for GEMSS
===========================================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/hdgfrom.svg

"hdg-from" is a simple command-line tool that generates HDG files for
the Global Environment Modelling System for Subsurface waters
(GEMSS_).

Example
-------

For instance, if you have data produced by the Storm Water
Management Model (SWMM_), say in a text file in for instance, you can
use `hdg-from` to obtain the equivalent HDG file by entering.

.. code-block:: console

    $ hdg-from --format swmm my-data.txt

Below are the options that `hdg-from` accepts:

 -f <format>, --format <format>

    The file format of the input file. So far only the SWMM format is
    available, but other my be supported in later version.

 -s <date>, --start-date <date>

    The date used as a starting point to convert simulated time into
    absolute time. Dates must adhere to the `ISO 8601` standard such
    as 2017-01-01T12:00:00. By default, the date used is Jan. 1, 2017
    at 12:00 AM.

 -u <name>, --user-name <name>

    The name of the user that creates the HDG file. Should be enclosed
    in double quotes it contains space. By default, the user name is
    "Unknown".

 -h, --help

    Show a similar description of the available options and exit.
